# TetrisMobKata
This is my persona intention to try to teach what I've read about specification pattern.
This exercice of mob programing is based on Tetris Kata:
https://gist.github.com/jameskbride/f7c6cbf133294518f1995744aa90a8e4
The goal here is to be able to take the tipically entangled code in a video game, match, enums, states and such
and isolate it in specifications undestanble by the nacked eye.
Wish us good luck, and enjoy!
